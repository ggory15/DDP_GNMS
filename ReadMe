This is DDP with multi-shooting method[1].

This code is based on https://kr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52069-ilqg-ddp-trajectory-optimization [2].

How to Use it
(1) open the demo_car.m
(2) Set M value 
    (if M = 500 -> DDP with Single shooting)
    (if M = 50 -> DDP with multiple shooting(10))
(3) Enjoy this.

ps. If you find some bugs in this code, plz send to me by mail (ggory15@snu.ac.kr)
